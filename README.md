**The official PVic Games website**, developed by [Gabriel Casanova](http://gabrielcasanova.com.br/). 

The website is a responsive, static single-page application built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. It features smooth navigation using React Router and supports both the Portuguese and English languages with i18n integration. Modern animations, implemented with Animate.css and AOS, enhance the user experience. The ''about'' page includes an interactive 3D model powered by the Three.js WebGL library.
