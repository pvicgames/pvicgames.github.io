Under his rule, creativity is stifled, self-expression is outlawed, and once-vibrant landscapes become dull and lifeless. As the influence of Pivolo’s tyranny spreads, society begins to question the value of art itself, forgetting its power to inspire, heal, and bring people together. It falls upon the four heroes—each wielding their own unique creative abilities—to challenge this bleak new reality.",

These mechanics are later combined in “final acts’, where players seamlessly chain actions across characters for exhilarating gameplay sequences.",

    "description": "PVic Games was founded in July, 2023 with the release of Ednaldo Pereira: Mobile. Created by art school dropout Pedro Victor 'Pvic' Gonçalves, a veteran in the Sonic community and later, the key gameplay programmer for Antonblast -- one of the most widely celebrated indie games in recent times -- PVic Games' founding ideals are simple: make high quality, artistic games that transcend our simplistic ideals of imagination and creativity and take us to another place. 'Pure Imagination' is more than a tagline, it's where our hearts are.",
