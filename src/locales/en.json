    "description": "PVic Games was founded in July, 2023 with the release of Ednaldo Pereira: Mobile. Created by art school dropout Pedro Victor 'Pvic' Gonçalves, a veteran in the Sonic community and later, the key gameplay programmer for Antonblast -- one of the most widely celebrated indie games in recent times -- PVic Games' founding ideals are simple: make high quality, artistic games that transcend our simplistic ideals of imagination and creativity and take us to another place. 'Pure Imagination' is more than a tagline, it's where our hearts are.",

    "description2": "The journey has just begun, and we invite you to step into our world of creative silence -- where imagination is the ultimate refuge of freedom."
