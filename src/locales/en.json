When he’s not painting or going on adventures with his friends, he enjoys making pasta for himself and, believe it or not, listening to electronic music. His favorite painters are Salvador Dalí and Van Gogh, but he has a special love for the hopefulness of Norman Rockwell. He joined the prestigious EdAN art school as a child, and thanks to his unwavering artistic professionalism and virtuosity, has gained both fans – and haters.

Still uncertain about his future and searching for his place in society, one thing remains clear: his life will always revolve around music. A lover of elegance, René has a deep appreciation for French perfumes, vintage cars, and fine dining, often taking it upon himself to teach his friends the finer points of etiquette and sophistication. However, his clumsiness and awkward demeanor often get in the way of making a good impression, leading him to fumble through words and actions, much to his own embarrassment.

Officially named Rupestrine Union, the city earned its title thanks to the discovery of some of the oldest archaeological sites in the region, filled with cave paintings, petroglyphs, and other forms of rock art. Over time, this deep artistic heritage transformed the city into a cultural hub, attracting musicians, painters, sculptors, dancers, and all those involved in the fine arts. This artistic flourishing culminated in the founding of the EdAN Art University, which stands for Excellens Doctrina Artis Nationum—meaning 'Excellence in the Teaching of the Arts of Nations'—a symbol of the city’s commitment to nurturing creativity. The city is undeniably rich, but many feel that the power is overly concentrated in the hands of the artistic elite. This concentration of influence has led to a sense of political isolation among the general population, fueling movements and growing anti-artist sentiment. The divide between the artists and the people has become a source of tension, with many citizens feeling excluded from the decisions and opportunities that shape their city’s future. While its cultural landscape is vibrant, Rupestrine's economy remains predominantly agricultural, with vast hectares dedicated to the cultivation of beans and coffee, supporting the livelihood of many in the region."

At the heart of this coastal haven lies Duck Lagoon, a magical beachfront where people, boats, and ships constantly come and go. Sunny skies, bright mornings, and rocky structures fill the area with charm and beauty. A perfect destination for a weekend or holiday, Duck Lagoon is one of the many places that make Rupestrine exceptional and special. Its surrounding waters are as sweet as candy, leaving a lasting impression on every foreigner. One of the many myths that captivate the minds of the city’s inhabitants is that of a mysterious figure—the ''bride''—who appears every full moon night. Some say she’s a bride, others claim she’s a duck, and some even describe her as a ''duck bride,'' whatever that means. No one knows for sure what she is or if she even exists, but those who have encountered her can assure you that she does. The name of the beach dates back to its founding when Spanish conquistadors took shelter there and accidentally let some of their ducks escape. The birds adapted well to the region and populated it, turning it into the cheerful, duck-filled shore we know today."
